# ISO 31000:2018 - Principles and Guidelines

**ISO 31000** provides principles and generic guidelines on risk management. VERGE adopts these high-level principles to ensure the application remains methodology-agnostic where possible, while enforcing rigor.

## 1. The Eight Principles (Clause 4)
Agents MUST ensure that VERGE's design supports these principles:

1.  **Integrated:** Risk management is an integral part of all organizational activities.
    *   *Docs Implication:* Risks should be linkable to Assets, Objectives, and Tasks (as supported by the Bowtie model).
2.  **Structured and Comprehensive:**
    *   *Docs Implication:* The rigorous use of Bowtie diagrams ensures structure.
3.  **Customized:**
    *   *Docs Implication:* The "Context" view allows customization to the organization's needs.
4.  **Inclusive:**
    *   *Docs Implication:* The application supports multiple stakeholders (Interested Parties).
5.  **Dynamic:** Risks emerge, change, or disappear.
    *   *Docs Implication:* The application supports "Current" vs "Target" states and updates over time.
6.  **Best Available Information:**
    *   *Docs Implication:* FAIR analysis requires using available data (calibrated estimates) rather than guessing.
7.  **Human and Cultural Factors:**
    *   *Docs Implication:* User experience (UX) matters; risk assessment should not be overly burdensome.
8.  **Continual Improvement:**
    *   *Docs Implication:* The risk register is not static.

## 2. The Framework (Clause 5)
Describes the leadership and commitment cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act logic).
*   **Design & Implementation:** VERGE supports this through the "Assessment List" (inventory of risks) and the ability to re-assess.

## 3. The Process (Clause 6)
This maps 1:1 with ISO 27005.
*   **6.4 Risk Assessment** (Identification -> Analysis -> Evaluation)
*   **6.5 Risk Treatment**

> **Note:** ISO 31000 is the "Parent" standard. ISO 27005 is the "Child" standard specific to InfoSec. Where they overlap, VERGE follows the more specific ISO 27005 guidance.
